# Klee - Artist Portfolio CMS

This is a very old piece of work that I wrote for a friend while learning 
PHP and before I actually had a job as a developer, so probably was back in 
2008 or something. Turned out the server available didn't have MySQL so it 
was re-factored to use an XML database instead, which worked fine but has various
complications.

This has so many things wrong with it like you can't add users and it
doesn't setup properly or anything (it just has a random script for setting
up the admin that you should delete after using!) but hey that's 
development! It's just here for posterity.
